When observe in habitat, the could be found in groups in areas of limited lightning. Surprisingly, however, they continued to emit a bright, fluorescent-like type of light, in some cases fully illuminatic small caves. This has led us to suspect that the plants generate some form of energy yet to be determined, which is supported by the readings in our Xeno-WaveLenght Emmission Tests. After continued testing for hostile effects returning negative results, we have decided to carry them back to Earth for further analysis.","\n",{"->":"QuestionsMenu"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["ev",{"^->":"PlantsInfo.0.c-1.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.15.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n",{"->":"QuestionsMenu"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"FungalInvasion":["^KosmosAI.Print(Sys_report)","\n","^ANOMALY DETECTED: Performance deviation [STEERING_RULESET]","\n","^ANOMALY DESCRIPTION: Unidentified maneuver requested [RETURN TO ORIGIN]","\n","^ANOMALY CAUSE [!UPDATED]: Alien substance detected in [COMPONENT:MBS Cholormid Neural Unit].
